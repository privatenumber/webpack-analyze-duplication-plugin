Detect duplicated modules in your Webpack build.

Produce a `duplication-report.json` that contains a full-report on duplicated modules.

Example snippet:
```json5
{
	// The duplicated module path
	"/node_modules/vue/dist/vue.esm.js": {

		// Size of module
		"size": "326.4 kB",

		// Size savings if de-duped
		"sizeImpact": "979.2 kB",

		// Chunks the module is duplicated in
		"includedIn": [
			["index.js"],
			["some-file.js"],
			...
		]
	},

	...
}
```

## 🙋‍♂️ Why?
Webpack configurations are complicated so it's easy to overlook misconfigurations and bloated distribution bundles.

Use this plugin to make sure there are no duplicated modules, or that they're only duplicated where you want them to be.

## 🚀 Install
```sh
npm i -D webpack-analyze-duplication-plugin
```

## 🚦 Quick Setup
Add to your `webpack.config.js`:

```diff
+ const AnalyzeDuplicationPlugin = require('webpack-analyze-duplication-plugin')

  module.exports = {
	  ...

      plugins: [
+         new AnalyzeDuplicationPlugin()
      ]
  }
```
